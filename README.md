# C-project05
This program allows the user to connect to a host network and communicate to other users on the host network. It also allows my computer to communite to other individual users
that are on online in the host network directly too. This project took a while to complete and is the hardest c project I have done so far. It was hard to get used to the concept since most
of the info needed to complete the project was not given in advance.
